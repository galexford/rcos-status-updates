This past week I've been working on the Android app database development. Recently,
we've decided to use Firebase for database storage, performance measurements,
and other robust app features that will be extremely useful as we develop more
and more. I've run into issues with connecting the Firebase server to our Android
app, but I am working on that this week. So far, I was able to implement a collection
of user data in Firebase. Once I connect the app to the server, I will be able to
add users to this server.
