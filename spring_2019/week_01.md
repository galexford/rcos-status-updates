## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I worked on the database schema and integrating Firebase with our Android app. I made a database
in the Firebase web app, but have not yet connected it to the Android app. Last week, I also researched Firebase's
capabilities and benefits compared to other frameworks.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan to commect the Android app to the Firebase server. This will allow me to connect some of the
already implemented frontend features to the backend features Firebase offers. Also, I will be able to store
user information.

## Anything Blocking?

I am having trouble locating my SHA 1 code needed to connect the app to the server, but I should be able to find
this, too.
